                  You speak a one-word command to a creature you can see within range. The target must succeed on a
                  Wisdom saving throw or follow the command on its next turn. The spell has no effect if the target is
                  undead, if it doesn't understand your language, or if your command is directly harmful to it. Some
                  typical commands and their effects follow. You might issue a command other than one described here. If
                  you do so, the GM determines how the target behaves. If the target can't follow your command, the
                  spell ends. Approach. The target moves toward you by the shortest and most direct route, ending its
                  turn if it moves within 5 feet of you. Drop. The target drops whatever it is holding and then ends its
                  turn. Flee. The target spends its turn moving away from you by the fastest available means. Grovel.
                  The target falls prone and then ends its turn. Halt. The target doesn't move and takes no actions. A
                  flying creature stays aloft, provided that it is able to do so. If it must move to stay aloft, it
                  flies the minimum distance needed to remain in the air.

                  fails on its saving throw. An affected creature is aware of the spell and can thus avoid answering

                  This spell creates an undead servant. Choose a pile of bones or a corpse of a Medium or Small humanoid
                  within range. Your spell imbues the target with a foul mimicry of life, raising it as an undead
                  creature. The target becomes a skeleton if you chose bones or a zombie if you chose a corpse (the GM
                  has the creature's game statistics). On each of your turns, you can use a bonus action to mentally
                  command any creature you made with this spell if the creature is within 60 feet of you (if you control
                  multiple creatures, you can command any or all of them at the same time, issuing the same command to
                  each one). You decide what action the creature will take and where it will move during its next turn,
                  or you can issue a general command, such as to guard a particular chamber or corridor. If you issue no
                  commands, the creature only defends itself against hostile creatures. Once given an order, the
                  creature continues to follow it until its task is complete. The creature is under your control for 24
                  hours, after which it stops obeying any command you've given it. To maintain control of the creature
                  for another 24 hours, you must cast this spell on the creature again before the current 24-hour period
                  ends. This use of the spell reasserts your control over up to four creatures you have animated with
                  this spell, rather than animating a new one.

                  options: Choose one ability score. While cursed, the target has disadvantage on ability checks and
                  saving throws made with that ability score. While cursed, the target has disadvantage on attack rolls
                  against you. While cursed, the target must make a Wisdom saving throw at the start of each of its
                  turns. If it fails, it wastes its action that turn doing nothing. While the target is cursed, your
                  attacks and spells deal an extra 1d8 necrotic damage to the target. A remove curse spell ends this
                  effect. At the GM's option, you may choose an alternative curse effect, but it should be no more
                  powerful than those described above. The GM has final say on such a curse's effect.

              Glyph of Warding
              <div class="table__td-spell-name__spell-description">
                <p>
                  When you cast this spell, you inscribe a glyph that harms other creatures, either upon a surface (such
                  as a table or a section of floor or wall) or within an object that can be closed (such as a book, a
                  scroll, or a treasure chest) to conceal the glyph. If you choose a surface, the glyph can cover an
                  area of the surface no larger than 10 feet in diameter. If you choose an object, that object must
                  remain in its place; if the object is moved more than 10 feet from where you cast this spell, the
                  glyph is broken, and the spell ends without being triggered. The glyph is nearly invisible and
                  requires a successful Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC to be found. You
                  decide what triggers the glyph when you cast the spell. For glyphs inscribed on a surface, the most
                  typical triggers include touching or standing on the glyph, removing another object covering the
                  glyph, approaching within a certain distance of the glyph, or manipulating the object on which the
                  glyph is inscribed. For glyphs inscribed within an object, the most common triggers include opening
                  that object, approaching within a certain distance of the object, or seeing or reading the glyph. Once
                  a glyph is triggered, this spell ends. You can further refine the trigger so the spell activates only
                  under certain circumstances or according to physical characteristics (such as height or weight),
                  creature kind (for example, the ward could be set to affect aberrations or drow), or alignment. You
                  can also set conditions for creatures that don't trigger the glyph, such as those who say a certain
                  password. When you inscribe the glyph, choose explosive runes or a spell glyph. Explosive Runes. When
                  triggered, the glyph erupts with magical energy in a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on the glyph. The
                  sphere spreads around corners. Each creature in the area must make a Dexterity saving throw. A
                  creature takes 5d8 acid, cold, fire, lightning, or thunder damage on a failed saving throw (your
                  choice when you create the glyph), or half as much damage on a successful one. Spell Glyph. You can
                  store a prepared spell of 3rd level or lower in the glyph by casting it as part of creating the glyph.
                  The spell must target a single creature or an area. The spell being stored has no immediate effect
                  when cast in this way. When the glyph is triggered, the stored spell is cast. If the spell has a
                  target, it targets the creature that triggered the glyph. If the spell affects an area, the area is
                  centered on that creature. If the spell summons hostile creatures or creates harmful objects or traps,
                  they appear as close as possible to the intruder and attack it. If the spell requires concentration,
                  it lasts until the end of its full duration.

                  At Higher Levels: When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the damage of an
                  explosive runes glyph increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 3rd. If you create a spell glyph, you

                  You attempt to send one creature that you can see within range to another plane of existence. The
                  target must succeed on a Charisma saving throw or be banished. If the target is native to the plane of
                  existence you're on, you banish the target to a harmless demiplane. While there, the target is
                  incapacitated. The target remains there until the spell ends, at which point the target reappears in
                  the space it left or in the nearest unoccupied space if that space is occupied. If the target is
                  native to a different plane of existence than the one you're on, the target is banished with a faint
                  popping noise, returning to its home plane. If the spell ends before 1 minute has passed, the target
                  reappears in the space it left or in the nearest unoccupied space if that space is occupied.
                  Otherwise, the target doesn't return.

              <div class="table__td-spell-name__spell-description">
                <p>
                  Until the spell ends, you control any freestanding water inside an area you choose that is a cube up
                  to 100 feet on a side. You can choose from any of the following effects when you cast this spell. As
                  an action on your turn, you can repeat the same effect or choose a different one. Flood. You cause the
                  water level of all standing water in the area to rise by as much as 20 feet. If the area includes a
                  shore, the flooding water spills over onto dry land. If you choose an area in a large body of water,
                  you instead create a 20-foot tall wave that travels from one side of the area to the other and then
                  crashes down. Any Huge or smaller vehicles in the wave's path are carried with it to the other side.
                  Any Huge or smaller vehicles struck by the wave have a 25 percent chance of capsizing. The water level
                  remains elevated until the spell ends or you choose a different effect. If this effect produced a
                  wave, the wave repeats on the start of your next turn while the flood effect lasts. Part Water. You
                  cause water in the area to move apart and create a trench. The trench extends across the spell's area,
                  and the separated water forms a wall to either side. The trench remains until the spell ends or you
                  choose a different effect. The water then slowly fills in the trench over the course of the next round
                  until the normal water level is restored. Redirect Flow. You cause flowing water in the area to move
                  in a direction you choose, even if the water has to flow over obstacles, up walls, or in other
                  unlikely directions. The water in the area moves as you direct it, but once it moves beyond the
                  spell's area, it resumes its flow based on the terrain conditions. The water continues to move in the
                  direction you chose until the spell ends or you choose a different effect. Whirlpool. This effect
                  requires a body of water at least 50 feet square and 25 feet deep. You cause a whirlpool to form in
                  the center of the area. The whirlpool forms a vortex that is 5 feet wide at the base, up to 50 feet
                  wide at the top, and 25 feet tall. Any creature or object in the water and within 25 feet of the
                  vortex is pulled 10 feet toward it. A creature can swim away from the vortex by making a Strength
                  (Athletics) check against your spell save DC. When a creature enters the vortex for the first time on
                  a turn or starts its turn there, it must make a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, the creature
                  takes 2d8 bludgeoning damage and is caught in the vortex until the spell ends. On a successful save,
                  the creature takes half damage, and isn't caught in the vortex. A creature caught in the vortex can
                  use its action to try to swim away from the vortex as described above, but has disadvantage on the
                  Strength (Athletics) check to do so. The first time each turn that an object enters the vortex, the
                  object takes 2d8 bludgeoning damage; this damage occurs each round it remains in the vortex.

                  You place a magical command on a creature that you can see within range, forcing it to carry out some
                  service or refrain from some action or course of activity as you decide. If the creature can
                  understand you, it must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or become charmed by you for the duration.
                  While the creature is charmed by you, it takes 5d10 psychic damage each time it acts in a manner
                  directly counter to your instructions, but no more than once each day. A creature that can't
                  understand you is unaffected by the spell. You can issue any command you choose, short of an activity

                  You touch a point and infuse an area around it with holy (or unholy) power. The area can have a radius
                  up to 60 feet, and the spell fails if the radius includes an area already under the effect a hallow
                  spell. The affected area is subject to the following effects. First, celestials, elementals, fey,
                  fiends, and undead can't enter the area, nor can such creatures charm, frighten, or possess creatures
                  within it. Any creature charmed, frightened, or possessed by such a creature is no longer charmed,
                  frightened, or possessed upon entering the area. You can exclude one or more of those types of
                  creatures from this effect. Second, you can bind an extra effect to the area. Choose the effect from
                  the following list, or choose an effect offered by the GM. Some of these effects apply to creatures in
                  the area; you can designate whether the effect applies to all creatures, creatures that follow a
                  specific deity or leader, or creatures of a specific sort, such as orcs or trolls. When a creature
                  that would be affected enters the spell's area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there,
                  it can make a Charisma saving throw. On a success, the creature ignores the extra effect until it
                  leaves the area. Courage. Affected creatures can't be frightened while in the area. Darkness. Darkness
                  fills the area. Normal light, as well as magical light created by spells of a lower level than the
                  slot you used to cast this spell, can't illuminate the area. Daylight. Bright light fills the area.
                  Magical darkness created by spells of a lower level than the slot you used to cast this spell can't
                  extinguish the light. Energy Protection. Affected creatures in the area have resistance to one damage
                  type of your choice, except for bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing. Energy Vulnerability. Affected
                  creatures in the area have vulnerability to one damage type of your choice, except for bludgeoning,
                  piercing, or slashing. Everlasting Rest. Dead bodies interred in the area can't be turned into undead.
                  Extradimensional Interference. Affected creatures can't move or travel using teleportation or by
                  extradimensional or interplanar means. Fear. Affected creatures are frightened while in the area.
                  Silence. No sound can emanate from within the area, and no sound can reach into it. Tongues. Affected

                  With this spell, you attempt to bind a celestial, an elemental, a fey, or a fiend to your service. The
                  creature must be within range for the entire casting of the spell. (Typically, the creature is first
                  summoned into the center of an inverted magic circle in order to keep it trapped while this spell is
                  cast.) At the completion of the casting, the target must make a Charisma saving throw. On a failed
                  save, it is bound to serve you for the duration. If the creature was summoned or created by another
                  spell, that spell's duration is extended to match the duration of this spell. A bound creature must
                  follow your instructions to the best of its ability. You might command the creature to accompany you
                  on an adventure, to guard a location, or to deliver a message. The creature obeys the letter of your
                  instructions, but if the creature is hostile to you, it strives to twist your words to achieve its own
                  objectives. If the creature carries out your instructions completely before the spell ends, it travels
                  to you to report this fact if you are on the same plane of existence. If you are on a different plane
                  of existence, it returns to the place where you bound it and remains there until the spell ends.

                  with 1 hit point. This spell also neutralizes any poisons and cures nonmagical diseases that affected
                  the creature at the time it died. This spell doesn't, however, remove magical diseases, curses, or
                  similar effects; if these aren't first removed prior to casting the spell, they take effect when the
                  creature returns to life. The spell can't return an undead creature to life. This spell closes all

                  Coming back from the dead is an ordeal. The target takes a &#8722;4 penalty to all attack rolls,

                  creates an invisible sensor within 10 feet of the target. You can see and hear through the sensor as
                  if you were there. The sensor moves with the target, remaining within 10 feet of it for the duration.
                  A creature that can see invisible objects sees the sensor as a luminous orb about the size of your

                  You can cast this spell only at night. Choose up to three corpses of Medium or Small humanoids within
                  range. Each corpse becomes a ghoul under your control. (The GM has game statistics for these
                  creatures.) As a bonus action on each of your turns, you can mentally command any creature you
                  animated with this spell if the creature is within 120 feet of you (if you control multiple creatures,
                  you can command any or all of them at the same time, issuing the same command to each one). You decide
                  what action the creature will take and where it will move during its next turn, or you can issue a
                  general command, such as to guard a particular chamber or corridor. If you issue no commands, the
                  creature only defends itself against hostile creatures. Once given an order, the creature continues to
                  follow it until its task is complete. The creature is under your control for 24 hours, after which it
                  stops obeying any command you have given it. To maintain control of the creature for another 24 hours,
                  you must cast this spell on the creature before the current 24-hour period ends. This use of the spell
                  reasserts your control over up to three creatures you have animated with this spell, rather than
                  animating new ones.

                  This spell allows you to find the shortest, most direct physical route to a specific fixed location
                  that you are familiar with on the same plane of existence. If you name a destination on another plane
                  of existence, a destination that moves (such as a mobile fortress), or a destination that isn't
                  specific (such as &#8220;a green dragon's lair&#8221;), the spell fails. For the duration, as long as
                  you are on the same plane of existence as the destination, you know how far it is and in what
                  direction it lies. While you are traveling there, whenever you are presented with a choice of paths
                  along the way, you automatically determine which path is the shortest and most direct route (but not
                  necessarily the safest route) to the destination.

                  You create a ward against magical travel that protects up to 40,000 square feet of floor space to a
                  height of 30 feet above the floor. For the duration, creatures can't teleport into the area or use
                  portals, such as those created by the gate spell, to enter the area. The spell proofs the area against
                  planar travel, and therefore prevents creatures from accessing the area by way of the Astral Plane,
                  Ethereal Plane, Feywild, Shadowfell, or the plane shift spell. In addition, the spell damages types of
                  creatures that you choose when you cast it. Choose one or more of the following: celestials,
                  elementals, fey, fiends, and undead. When a chosen creature enters the spell's area for the first time
                  on a turn or starts its turn there, the creature takes 5d10 radiant or necrotic damage (your choice
                  when you cast this spell). When you cast this spell, you can designate a password. A creature that
                  speaks the password as it enters the area takes no damage from the spell. The spell's area can't
                  overlap with the area of another forbiddance spell. If you cast forbiddance every day for 30 days in
                  the same location, the spell lasts until it is dispelled, and the material components are consumed on
                  the last casting.

                  a successful save. The damage can't reduce the target's hit points below 1. If the target fails the

                  You beseech an otherworldly entity for aid. The being must be known to you: a god, a primordial, a
                  demon prince, or some other being of cosmic power. That entity sends a celestial, an elemental, or a
                  fiend loyal to it to aid you, making the creature appear in an unoccupied space within range. If you
                  know a specific creature's name, you can speak that name when you cast this spell to request that
                  creature, though you might get a different creature anyway (GM's choice). When the creature appears,
                  it is under no compulsion to behave in any particular way. You can ask the creature to perform a
                  service in exchange for payment, but it isn't obliged to do so. The requested task could range from
                  simple (fly us across the chasm, or help us fight a battle) to complex (spy on our enemies, or protect
                  us during our foray into the dungeon). You must be able to communicate with the creature to bargain
                  for its services. Payment can take a variety of forms. A celestial might require a sizable donation of
                  gold or magic items to an allied temple, while a fiend might demand a living sacrifice or a gift of
                  treasure. Some creatures might exchange their service for a quest undertaken by you. As a rule of
                  thumb, a task that can be measured in minutes requires a payment worth 100 gp per minute. A task
                  measured in hours requires 1,000 gp per hour. And a task measured in days (up to 10 days) requires
                  10,000 gp per day. The GM can adjust these payments based on the circumstances under which you cast
                  the spell. If the task is aligned with the creature's ethos, the payment might be halved or even
                  waived. Nonhazardous tasks typically require only half the suggested payment, while especially
                  dangerous tasks might require a greater gift. Creatures rarely accept tasks that seem suicidal. After
                  the creature completes the task, or when the agreed-upon duration of service expires, the creature
                  returns to its home plane after reporting back to you, if appropriate to the task and if possible. If
                  you are unable to agree on a price for the creature's service, the creature immediately returns to its
                  home plane. A creature enlisted to join your group counts as a member of it, receiving a full share of
                  experience points awarded.

                  the nearest unoccupied space that you can occupy and take force damage equal to twice the number of
                  feet you are moved. This spell has no effect if you cast it while you are on the Ethereal Plane or a
                  plane that doesn't border it, such as one of the Outer Planes.

                  At Higher Levels: When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 8th level or higher, you can target
                  up to three willing creatures (including you) for each slot level above 7th. The creatures must be
                  within 10 feet of you when you cast the spell.

                  You and up to eight willing creatures who link hands in a circle are transported to a different plane
                  of existence. You can specify a target destination in general terms, such as the City of Brass on the
                  Elemental Plane of Fire or the palace of Dispater on the second level of the Nine Hells, and you
                  appear in or near that destination. If you are trying to reach the City of Brass, for example, you
                  might arrive in its Street of Steel, before its Gate of Ashes, or looking at the city from across the
                  Sea of Fire, at the GM's discretion. Alternatively, if you know the sigil sequence of a teleportation
                  circle on another plane of existence, this spell can take you to that circle. If the teleportation
                  circle is too small to hold all the creatures you transported, they appear in the closest unoccupied
                  spaces next to the circle. You can use this spell to banish an unwilling creature to another plane.
                  Choose a creature within your reach and make a melee spell attack against it. On a hit, the creature
                  must make a Charisma saving throw. If the creature fails this save, it is transported to a random
                  location on the plane of existence you specify. A creature so transported must find its own way back
                  to your current plane of existence.

                  You touch a dead creature that has been dead for no more than a century, that didn't die of old age,
                  and that isn't undead. If its soul is free and willing, the target returns to life with all its hit
                  points. This spell neutralizes any poisons and cures normal diseases afflicting the creature when it
                  died. It doesn't, however, remove magical diseases, curses, and the like; if such effects aren't
                  removed prior to casting the spell, they afflict the target on its return to life. This spell closes
                  all mortal wounds and restores any missing body parts. Coming back from the dead is an ordeal. The
                  target takes a &#8722;4 penalty to all attack rolls, saving throws, and ability checks. Every time the
                  target finishes a long rest, the penalty is reduced by 1 until it disappears. Casting this spell to
                  restore life to a creature that has been dead for one year or longer taxes you greatly. Until you
                  finish a long rest, you can't cast spells again, and you have disadvantage on all attack rolls,

                  When you cast this spell, you inscribe a harmful glyph either on a surface (such as a section of
                  floor, a wall, or a table) or within an object that can be closed to conceal the glyph (such as a
                  book, a scroll, or a treasure chest). If you choose a surface, the glyph can cover an area of the
                  surface no larger than 10 feet in diameter. If you choose an object, that object must remain in its
                  place; if the object is moved more than 10 feet from where you cast this spell, the glyph is broken,
                  and the spell ends without being triggered. The glyph is nearly invisible, requiring an Intelligence
                  (Investigation) check against your spell save DC to find it. You decide what triggers the glyph when
                  you cast the spell. For glyphs inscribed on a surface, the most typical triggers include touching or
                  stepping on the glyph, removing another object covering it, approaching within a certain distance of
                  it, or manipulating the object that holds it. For glyphs inscribed within an object, the most common
                  triggers are opening the object, approaching within a certain distance of it, or seeing or reading the
                  glyph. You can further refine the trigger so the spell is activated only under certain circumstances
                  or according to a creature's physical characteristics (such as height or weight), or physical kind
                  (for example, the ward could be set to affect hags or shapechangers). You can also specify creatures
                  that don't trigger the glyph, such as those who say a certain password. When you inscribe the glyph,
                  choose one of the options below for its effect. Once triggered, the glyph glows, filling a
                  60-foot-radius sphere with dim light for 10 minutes, after which time the spell ends. Each creature in
                  the sphere when the glyph activates is targeted by its effect, as is a creature that enters the sphere
                  for the first time on a turn or ends its turn there. Death. Each target must make a Constitution
                  saving throw, taking 10d10 necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful
                  save. Discord. Each target must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a target bickers
                  and argues with other creatures for 1 minute. During this time, it is incapable of meaningful
                  communication and has disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks. Fear. Each target must make a
                  Wisdom saving throw and becomes frightened for 1 minute on a failed save. While frightened, the target
                  drops whatever it is holding and must move at least 30 feet away from the glyph on each of its turns,
                  if able. Hopelessness. Each target must make a Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, the target is
                  overwhelmed with despair for 1 minute. During this time, it can't attack or target any creature with
                  harmful abilities, spells, or other magical effects. Insanity. Each target must make an Intelligence
                  saving throw. On a failed save, the target is driven insane for 1 minute. An insane creature can't
                  take actions, can't understand what other creatures say, can't read, and speaks only in gibberish. The
                  GM controls its movement, which is erratic. Pain. Each target must make a Constitution saving throw
                  and becomes incapacitated with excruciating pain for 1 minute on a failed save. Sleep. Each target
                  must make a Wisdom saving throw and falls unconscious for 10 minutes on a failed save. A creature
                  awakens if it takes damage or if someone uses an action to shake or slap it awake. Stunning. Each
                  target must make a Wisdom saving throw and becomes stunned for 1 minute on a failed save.

                <p>
                  A 10-foot-radius invisible sphere of antimagic surrounds you. This area is divorced from the magical
                  energy that suffuses the multiverse. Within the sphere, spells can't be cast, summoned creatures
                  disappear, and even magic items become mundane. Until the spell ends, the sphere moves with you,
                  centered on you. Spells and other magical effects, except those created by an artifact or a deity, are
                  suppressed in the sphere and can't protrude into it. A slot expended to cast a suppressed spell is
                  consumed. While an effect is suppressed, it doesn't function, but the time it spends suppressed counts
                  against its duration. Targeted Effects. Spells and other magical effects, such as magic missile and
                  charm person, that target a creature or an object in the sphere have no effect on that target. Areas
                  of Magic. The area of another spell or magical effect, such as fireball, can't extend into the sphere.
                  If the sphere overlaps an area of magic, the part of the area that is covered by the sphere is
                  suppressed. For example, the flames created by a wall of fire are suppressed within the sphere,
                  creating a gap in the wall if the overlap is large enough. Spells. Any active spell or other magical
                  effect on a creature or an object in the sphere is suppressed while the creature or object is in it.
                  Magic Items. The properties and powers of magic items are suppressed in the sphere. For example, a +1
                  longsword in the sphere functions as a nonmagical longsword. A magic weapon's properties and powers
                  are suppressed if it is used against a target in the sphere or wielded by an attacker in the sphere.
                  If a magic weapon or a piece of magic ammunition fully leaves the sphere (for example, if you fire a
                  magic arrow or throw a magic spear at a target outside the sphere), the magic of the item ceases to be
                  suppressed as soon as it exits. Magical Travel. Teleportation and planar travel fail to work in the
                  sphere, whether the sphere is the destination or the departure point for such magical travel. A portal
                  to another location, world, or plane of existence, as well as an opening to an extradimensional space
                  such as that created by the rope trick spell, temporarily closes while in the sphere. Creatures and
                  Objects. A creature or object summoned or created by magic temporarily winks out of existence in the
                  sphere. Such a creature instantly reappears once the space the creature occupied is no longer within
                  the sphere. Dispel Magic. Spells and magical effects such as dispel magic have no effect on the
                  sphere. Likewise, the spheres created by different antimagic field spells don't nullify each other.

                  you cast the spell, you change the current weather conditions, which are determined by the GM based on
                  the climate and season. You can change precipitation, temperature, and wind. It takes 1d4 &#215; 10
                  minutes for the new conditions to take effect. Once they do so, you can change the conditions again.

                  You create a seismic disturbance at a point on the ground that you can see within range. For the
                  duration, an intense tremor rips through the ground in a 100-foot-radius circle centered on that point
                  and shakes creatures and structures in contact with the ground in that area. The ground in the area
                  becomes difficult terrain. Each creature on the ground that is concentrating must make a Constitution
                  saving throw. On a failed save, the creature's concentration is broken. When you cast this spell and
                  at the end of each turn you spend concentrating on it, each creature on the ground in the area must
                  make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is knocked prone. This spell can have
                  additional effects depending on the terrain in the area, as determined by the GM. Fissures. Fissures
                  open throughout the spell's area at the start of your next turn after you cast the spell. A total of
                  1d6 such fissures open in locations chosen by the GM. Each is 1d10 &#215; 10 feet deep, 10 feet wide,
                  and extends from one edge of the spell's area to the opposite side. A creature standing on a spot
                  where a fissure opens must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or fall in. A creature that
                  successfully saves moves with the fissure's edge as it opens. A fissure that opens beneath a structure
                  causes it to automatically collapse (see below). Structures. The tremor deals 50 bludgeoning damage to
                  any structure in contact with the ground in the area when you cast the spell and at the start of each
                  of your turns until the spell ends. If a structure drops to 0 hit points, it collapses and potentially
                  damages nearby creatures. A creature within half the distance of a structure's height must make a
                  Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 5d6 bludgeoning damage, is knocked prone,
                  and is buried in the rubble, requiring a DC 20 Strength (Athletics) check as an action to escape. The
                  GM can adjust the DC higher or lower, depending on the nature of the rubble. On a successful save, the
                  creature takes half as much damage and doesn't fall prone or become buried.

                  You and up to eight willing creatures within range project your astral bodies into the Astral Plane
                  (the spell fails and the casting is wasted if you are already on that plane). The material body you
                  leave behind is unconscious and in a state of suspended animation; it doesn't need food or air and
                  doesn't age. Your astral body resembles your mortal form in almost every way, replicating your game
                  statistics and possessions. The principal difference is the addition of a silvery cord that extends
                  from between your shoulder blades and trails behind you, fading to invisibility after 1 foot. This
                  cord is your tether to your material body. As long as the tether remains intact, you can find your way
                  home. If the cord is cut&#8212;something that can happen only when an effect specifically states that
                  it does&#8212;your soul and body are separated, killing you instantly. Your astral form can freely
                  travel through the Astral Plane and can pass through portals there leading to any other plane. If you
                  enter a new plane or return to the plane you were on when casting this spell, your body and
                  possessions are transported along the silver cord, allowing you to re-enter your body as you enter the
                  new plane. Your astral form is a separate incarnation. Any damage or other effects that apply to it
                  have no effect on your physical body, nor do they persist when you return to it. The spell ends for
                  you and your companions when you use your action to dismiss it. When the spell ends, the affected
                  creature returns to its physical body, and it awakens. The spell might also end early for you or one
                  of your companions. A successful dispel magic spell used against an astral or physical body ends the
                  spell for that creature. If a creature's original body or its astral form drops to 0 hit points, the
                  spell ends for that creature. If the spell ends and the silver cord is intact, the cord pulls the
                  creature's astral form back to its body, ending its state of suspended animation. If you are returned
                  to your body prematurely, your companions remain in their astral forms and must find their own way
                  back to their bodies, usually by dropping to 0 hit points.

                  You conjure a portal linking an unoccupied space you can see within range to a precise location on a
                  different plane of existence. The portal is a circular opening, which you can make 5 to 20 feet in
                  diameter. You can orient the portal in any direction you choose. The portal lasts for the duration.
                  The portal has a front and a back on each plane where it appears. Travel through the portal is
                  possible only by moving through its front. Anything that does so is instantly transported to the other
                  plane, appearing in the unoccupied space nearest to the portal. Deities and other planar rulers can
                  prevent portals created by this spell from opening in their presence or anywhere within their domains.
                  When you cast this spell, you can speak the name of a specific creature (a pseudonym, title, or
                  nickname doesn't work). If that creature is on a plane other than the one you are on, the portal opens
                  in the named creature's immediate vicinity and draws the creature through it to the nearest unoccupied
                  space on your side of the portal. You gain no special power over the creature, and it is free to act
                  as the GM deems appropriate. It might leave, attack you, or help you.

                  You speak a one-word command to a creature you can see within range. The target must succeed on a
                  Wisdom saving throw or follow the command on its next turn. The spell has no effect if the target is
                  undead, if it doesn't understand your language, or if your command is directly harmful to it. Some
                  typical commands and their effects follow. You might issue a command other than one described here. If
                  you do so, the GM determines how the target behaves. If the target can't follow your command, the
                  spell ends. Approach. The target moves toward you by the shortest and most direct route, ending its
                  turn if it moves within 5 feet of you. Drop. The target drops whatever it is holding and then ends its
                  turn. Flee. The target spends its turn moving away from you by the fastest available means. Grovel.
                  The target falls prone and then ends its turn. Halt. The target doesn't move and takes no actions. A
                  flying creature stays aloft, provided that it is able to do so. If it must move to stay aloft, it
                  flies the minimum distance needed to remain in the air.

                  By casting gem-inlaid sticks, rolling dragon bones, laying out ornate cards, or employing some other
                  divining tool, you receive an omen from an otherworldly entity about the results of a specific course
                  of action that you plan to take within the next 30 minutes. The GM chooses from the following possible
                  omens: Weal, for good results Woe, for bad results Weal and woe, for both good and bad results
                  Nothing, for results that aren't especially good or bad The spell doesn't take into account any
                  possible circumstances that might change the outcome, such as the casting of additional spells or the
                  loss or gain of a companion. If you cast the spell two or more times before completing your next long

                  this effect. The suggestion must be worded in such a manner as to make the course of action sound
                  reasonable. Asking the creature to stab itself, throw itself onto a spear, immolate itself, or do some
                  other obviously harmful act ends the spell. The target must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed
                  save, it pursues the course of action you described to the best of its ability. The suggested course
                  of action can continue for the entire duration. If the suggested activity can be completed in a
                  shorter time, the spell ends when the subject finishes what it was asked to do. You can also specify

                  This spell assaults and twists creatures' minds, spawning delusions and provoking uncontrolled action.
                  Each creature in a 10-foot-radius sphere centered on a point you choose within range must succeed on a
                  Wisdom saving throw when you cast this spell or be affected by it. An affected target can't take
                  reactions and must roll a d10 at the start of each of its turns to determine its behavior for that
                  turn. d10 Behavior 1 The creature uses all its movement to move in a random direction. To determine
                  the direction, roll a d8 and assign a direction to each die face. The creature doesn't take an action
                  this turn. 2&#8211;6 The creature doesn't move or take actions this turn. 7&#8211;8 The creature uses
                  its action to make a melee attack against a randomly determined creature within its reach. If there is
                  no creature within its reach, the creature does nothing this turn. 9&#8211;10 The creature can act and
                  move normally. At the end of each of its turns, an affected target can make a Wisdom saving throw. If
                  it succeeds, this effect ends for that target.

                  Name or describe a person, place, or object. The spell brings to your mind a brief summary of the
                  significant lore about the thing you named. The lore might consist of current tales, forgotten
                  stories, or even secret lore that has never been widely known. If the thing you named isn't of
                  legendary importance, you gain no information. The more information you already have about the thing,
                  the more precise and detailed the information you receive is. The information you learn is accurate
                  but might be couched in figurative language. For example, if you have a mysterious magic axe on hand,
                  the spell might yield this information: &#8220;Woe to the evildoer whose hand touches the axe, for
                  even the haft slices the hand of the evil ones. Only a true Child of Stone, lover and beloved of
                  Moradin, may awaken the true powers of the axe, and only with the sacred word Rudnogg on the

                  creates an invisible sensor within 10 feet of the target. You can see and hear through the sensor as
                  if you were there. The sensor moves with the target, remaining within 10 feet of it for the duration.
                  A creature that can see invisible objects sees the sensor as a luminous orb about the size of your
                  fist. Instead of targeting a creature, you can choose a location you have seen before as the target of
                  this spell. When you do, the sensor appears at that location and doesn't move.

                  creates an invisible sensor within 10 feet of the target. You can see and hear through the sensor as
                  if you were there. The sensor moves with the target, remaining within 10 feet of it for the duration.
                  A creature that can see invisible objects sees the sensor as a luminous orb about the size of your
                  fist. Instead of targeting a creature, you can choose a location you have seen before as the target of
                  this spell. When you do, the sensor appears at that location and doesn't move.

                  a point within range. All normal plants in a 100-foot radius centered on that point become thick and
                  overgrown. A creature moving through the area must spend 4 feet of movement for every 1 foot it moves.
                  You can exclude one or more areas of any size within the spell's area from being affected. If you cast
                  this spell over 8 hours, you enrich the land. All plants in a half-mile radius centered on a point
                  within range become enriched for 1 year. The plants yield twice the normal amount of food when
                  harvested.

                <p>
                  A wall of strong wind rises from the ground at a point you choose within range. You can make the wall
                  up to 50 feet long, 15 feet high, and 1 foot thick. You can shape the wall in any way you choose so
                  long as it makes one continuous path along the ground. The wall lasts for the duration. When the wall
                  appears, each creature within its area must make a Strength saving throw. A creature takes 3d8
                  bludgeoning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. The strong wind keeps
                  fog, smoke, and other gases at bay. Small or smaller flying creatures or objects can't pass through
                  the wall. Loose, lightweight materials brought into the wall fly upward. Arrows, bolts, and other
                  ordinary projectiles launched at targets behind the wall are deflected upward and automatically miss.
                  (Boulders hurled by giants or siege engines, and similar projectiles, are unaffected.) Creatures in
                  gaseous form can't pass through it.

                  You attempt to beguile a beast that you can see within range. It must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw
                  or be charmed by you for the duration. If you or creatures that are friendly to you are fighting it,
                  it has advantage on the saving throw. While the beast is charmed, you have a telepathic link with it
                  as long as the two of you are on the same plane of existence. You can use this telepathic link to
                  issue commands to the creature while you are conscious (no action required), which it does its best to
                  obey. You can specify a simple and general course of action, such as &#8220;Attack that
                  creature,&#8221; &#8220;Run over there,&#8221; or &#8220;Fetch that object.&#8221; If the creature
                  completes the order and doesn't receive further direction from you, it defends and preserves itself to
                  the best of its ability. You can use your action to take total and precise control of the target.
                  Until the end of your next turn, the creature takes only the actions you choose, and doesn't do
                  anything that you don't allow it to do. During this time, you can also cause the creature to use a
                  reaction, but this requires you to use your own reaction as well. Each time the target takes damage,
                  it makes a new Wisdom saving throw against the spell. If the saving throw succeeds, the spell ends.

                  down from the cloud to that point. Each creature within 5 feet of that point must make a Dexterity
                  saving throw. A creature takes 3d10 lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a

                  water level of all standing water in the area to rise by as much as 20 feet. If the area includes a
                  shore, the flooding water spills over onto dry land. If you choose an area in a large body of water,
                  you instead create a 20-foot tall wave that travels from one side of the area to the other and then
                  crashes down. Any Huge or smaller vehicles in the wave's path are carried with it to the other side.
                  Any Huge or smaller vehicles struck by the wave have a 25 percent chance of capsizing. The water level
                  remains elevated until the spell ends or you choose a different effect. If this effect produced a
                  wave, the wave repeats on the start of your next turn while the flood effect lasts. Part Water. You
                  cause water in the area to move apart and create a trench. The trench extends across the spell's area,
                  and the separated water forms a wall to either side. The trench remains until the spell ends or you
                  choose a different effect. The water then slowly fills in the trench over the course of the next round
                  until the normal water level is restored. Redirect Flow. You cause flowing water in the area to move
                  in a direction you choose, even if the water has to flow over obstacles, up walls, or in other
                  unlikely directions. The water in the area moves as you direct it, but once it moves beyond the
                  spell's area, it resumes its flow based on the terrain conditions. The water continues to move in the
                  direction you chose until the spell ends or you choose a different effect. Whirlpool. This effect
                  requires a body of water at least 50 feet square and 25 feet deep. You cause a whirlpool to form in
                  the center of the area. The whirlpool forms a vortex that is 5 feet wide at the base, up to 50 feet
                  wide at the top, and 25 feet tall. Any creature or object in the water and within 25 feet of the
                  vortex is pulled 10 feet toward it. A creature can swim away from the vortex by making a Strength
                  (Athletics) check against your spell save DC. When a creature enters the vortex for the first time on
                  a turn or starts its turn there, it must make a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, the creature
                  takes 2d8 bludgeoning damage and is caught in the vortex until the spell ends. On a successful save,
                  the creature takes half damage, and isn't caught in the vortex. A creature caught in the vortex can
                  use its action to try to swim away from the vortex as described above, but has disadvantage on the
                  Strength (Athletics) check to do so. The first time each turn that an object enters the vortex, the
                  object takes 2d8 bludgeoning damage; this damage occurs each round it remains in the vortex.

                  type, so you must adopt a form that has the same basic arrangement of limbs. Otherwise, the extent of
                  the illusion is up to you. The changes wrought by this spell fail to hold up to physical inspection.
                  For example, if you use this spell to add a hat to your outfit, objects pass through the hat, and

                  Three illusory duplicates of yourself appear in your space. Until the spell ends, the duplicates move
                  with you and mimic your actions, shifting position so it's impossible to track which image is real.
                  You can use your action to dismiss the illusory duplicates. Each time a creature targets you with an
                  attack during the spell's duration, roll a d20 to determine whether the attack instead targets one of
                  your duplicates. If you have three duplicates, you must roll a 6 or higher to change the attack's
                  target to a duplicate. With two duplicates, you must roll an 8 or higher. With one duplicate, you must
                  roll an 11 or higher. A duplicate's AC equals 10 + your Dexterity modifier. If an attack hits a
                  duplicate, the duplicate is destroyed. A duplicate can be destroyed only by an attack that hits it. It
                  ignores all other damage and effects. The spell ends when all three duplicates are destroyed. A
                  creature is unaffected by this spell if it can't see, if it relies on senses other than sight, such as
                  blindsight, or if it can perceive illusions as false, as with truesight.

                  This spell transforms a creature that you can see within range into a new form. An unwilling creature
                  must make a Wisdom saving throw to avoid the effect. The spell has no effect on a shapechanger or a
                  creature with 0 hit points. The transformation lasts for the duration, or until the target drops to 0
                  hit points or dies. The new form can be any beast whose challenge rating is equal to or less than the
                  target's (or the target's level, if it doesn't have a challenge rating). The target's game statistics,
                  including mental ability scores, are replaced by the statistics of the chosen beast. It retains its
                  alignment and personality. The target assumes the hit points of its new form. When it reverts to its
                  normal form, the creature returns to the number of hit points it had before it transformed. If it

                  long as the excess damage doesn't reduce the creature's normal form to 0 hit points, it isn't knocked
                  unconscious. The creature is limited in the actions it can perform by the nature of its new form, and
                  it can't speak, cast spells, or take any other action that requires hands or speech. The target's gear
                  melds into the new form. The creature can't activate, use, wield, or otherwise benefit from any of its
                  equipment.

                  You attempt to beguile a humanoid that you can see within range. It must succeed on a Wisdom saving
                  throw or be charmed by you for the duration. If you or creatures that are friendly to you are fighting
                  it, it has advantage on the saving throw. While the target is charmed, you have a telepathic link with
                  it as long as the two of you are on the same plane of existence. You can use this telepathic link to
                  issue commands to the creature while you are conscious (no action required), which it does its best to
                  obey. You can specify a simple and general course of action, such as &#8220;Attack that
                  creature,&#8221; &#8220;Run over there,&#8221; or &#8220;Fetch that object.&#8221; If the creature
                  completes the order and doesn't receive further direction from you, it defends and preserves itself to
                  the best of its ability. You can use your action to take total and precise control of the target.
                  Until the end of your next turn, the creature takes only the actions you choose, and doesn't do
                  anything that you don't allow it to do. During this time you can also cause the creature to use a
                  reaction, but this requires you to use your own reaction as well. Each time the target takes damage,
                  it makes a new Wisdom saving throw against the spell. If the saving throw succeeds, the spell ends. At
                  Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a 6th-level spell slot, the duration is concentration,
                  up to 10 minutes. When you use a 7th-level spell slot, the duration is concentration, up to 1 hour.
                  When you use a spell slot of 8th level or higher, the duration is concentration, up to 8 hours.

                  You attempt to reshape another creature's memories. One creature that you can see must make a Wisdom
                  saving throw. If you are fighting the creature, it has advantage on the saving throw. On a failed
                  save, the target becomes charmed by you for the duration. The charmed target is incapacitated and
                  unaware of its surroundings, though it can still hear you. If it takes any damage or is targeted by
                  another spell, this spell ends, and none of the target's memories are modified. While this charm
                  lasts, you can affect the target's memory of an event that it experienced within the last 24 hours and
                  that lasted no more than 10 minutes. You can permanently eliminate all memory of the event, allow the
                  target to recall the event with perfect clarity and exacting detail, change its memory of the details
                  of the event, or create a memory of some other event. You must speak to the target to describe how its
                  memories are affected, and it must be able to understand your language for the modified memories to
                  take root. Its mind fills in any gaps in the details of your description. If the spell ends before you
                  have finished describing the modified memories, the creature's memory isn't altered. Otherwise, the
                  modified memories take hold when the spell ends. A modified memory doesn't necessarily affect how a
                  creature behaves, particularly if the memory contradicts the creature's natural inclinations,
                  alignment, or beliefs. An illogical modified memory, such as implanting a memory of how much the
                  creature enjoyed dousing itself in acid, is dismissed, perhaps as a bad dream. The GM might deem a
                  modified memory too nonsensical to affect a creature in a significant manner. A remove curse or
                  greater restoration spell cast on the target restores the creature's true memory.
