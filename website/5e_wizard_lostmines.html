                  A spectral, floating hand appears at a point you choose within range. The hand lasts for the duration

                  or if you cast this spell again. You can use your action to control the hand. You can use the hand to
                  manipulate an object, open an unlocked door or container, stow or retrieve an item from an open
                  container, or pour the contents out of a vial. You can move the hand up to 30 feet each time you use
                  it. The hand can't attack, activate magic items, or carry more than 10 pounds.

                  This spell is a minor magical trick that novice spellcasters use for practice. You create one of the
                  following magical effects within range: You create an instantaneous, harmless sensory effect, such as
                  a shower of sparks, a puff of wind, faint musical notes, or an odd odor. You instantaneously light or
                  snuff out a candle, a torch, or a small campfire. You instantaneously clean or soil an object no
                  larger than 1 cubic foot. You chill, warm, or flavor up to 1 cubic foot of nonliving material for 1
                  hour. You make a color, a small mark, or a symbol appear on an object or a surface for 1 hour. You
                  create a nonmagical trinket or an illusory image that can fit in your hand and that lasts until the
                  end of your next turn. If you cast this spell multiple times, you can have up to three of its
                  non-instantaneous effects active at a time, and you can dismiss such an effect as an action.

                  A creature takes 3d6 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. The

                  that bears magic, and you learn its school of magic, if any. The spell can penetrate most barriers,
                  but it is blocked by 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of common metal, a thin sheet of lead, or 3 feet of wood

                  This spell sends creatures into a magical slumber. Roll 5d8; the total is how many hit points of
                  creatures this spell can affect. Creatures within 20 feet of a point you choose within range are
                  affected in ascending order of their current hit points (ignoring unconscious creatures). Starting
                  with the creature that has the lowest current hit points, each creature affected by this spell falls
                  unconscious until the spell ends, the sleeper takes damage, or someone uses an action to shake or slap
                  the sleeper awake. Subtract each creature's hit points from the total before moving on to the creature
                  with the next lowest hit points. A creature's hit points must be equal to or less than the remaining
                  total for that creature to be affected. Undead and creatures immune to being charmed aren't affected
                  by this spell.
